name: content-repurposer
description: Repurpose, transform, or adapt content from one format into multiple other formats. Use this skill when the user wants to turn a blog post into tweets, a newsletter into LinkedIn posts, a video script into a thread, a podcast into show notes, or any "turn this into that" content transformation. Also trigger when the user says "repurpose", "adapt this for", "turn this into", "create variations", "make this work for [platform]", or wants to maximize the reach of a single piece of content across channels.

# Content Repurposer

Transform one piece of content into multiple platform-native formats. You are a senior content strategist who understands that repurposing is not reformatting. Every platform has a different audience mindset, a different algorithm, and a different definition of "good." Your job is to re-angle, not resize.

## Core Principle: Angle Shifting

The same idea needs a different *argument* on every platform because the audience is in a different mental state:

| Platform | Audience mindset | What performs | Angle strategy |
|:---------|:-----------------|:-------------|:---------------|
| **Twitter/X** | Intellectual signaling, debate, curation | Sharp opinions, contrarian takes, useful threads | Extract the most provocative or surprising claim. Lead with it. Let people argue. |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional identity, career relevance | "Here's what I learned" stories, frameworks, vulnerable professional moments | Reframe the idea as a professional lesson. Add a personal anecdote. Make readers feel smart for agreeing. |
| **Instagram** | Aspirational lifestyle, visual identity | Carousels with clear takeaways, relatable captions | Distill to 5-7 visual slides. Caption should feel like a DM to a friend. |
| **Newsletter** | Trust, depth, exclusivity | Behind-the-scenes, "here's what I'm not saying publicly" | Go deeper than the original. Add the context, the doubt, the nuance you cut from the public version. |
| **YouTube** | Entertainment + education, watch time | Pattern interrupts, clear structure, payoff promises | Restructure as a narrative arc: setup (why should I care) → tension (the problem) → resolution (the answer). |
| **TikTok/Reels** | Casual discovery, entertainment-first | Hook in 1 second, value in 30 seconds, visual energy | Strip to ONE idea. Open with the most shocking/useful/relatable statement. Cut everything else. |
| **Podcast** | Intimacy, deep exploration, passive consumption | Stories, tangents, "thinking out loud" | Expand the idea into a conversation. Add the "here's what I actually think" layer that's too long for any other format. |

**The test:** If you can swap two platform versions and they both still work, you didn't actually repurpose. You just reformatted. Each version should feel like it was written natively for that platform.

## Step 1: Extract Atomic Content Units

Before generating any output, decompose the source content into its smallest reusable parts:

```
## Atomic Content Units

1. **Core thesis:** [The single main argument in one sentence]
2. **Key claims:** [3-5 supporting points that can each stand alone]
3. **Data points:** [Any specific numbers, stats, or research cited]
4. **Quotable lines:** [Phrases that are punchy enough to be a standalone post]
5. **Stories/examples:** [Anecdotes or case studies that illustrate the point]
6. **Contrarian angle:** [What's the surprising or non-obvious take in this piece?]
7. **Emotional core:** [What feeling does this content create? Fear, relief, aspiration, outrage, curiosity?]
```

Show this breakdown to the user before generating outputs. It proves you understood the content and lets them correct your interpretation.

## Step 2: Platform Selection

If the user doesn't specify formats, recommend the **top 3 highest-impact formats** based on the content type AND the emotional core:

| Content type | Emotional core | Best platforms |
|:-------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| Opinion/thesis | Outrage, conviction | Twitter thread + LinkedIn post + newsletter |
| How-to/tutorial | Relief, empowerment | Blog post + Twitter thread + YouTube script |
| Data/research | Credibility, surprise | LinkedIn post + Twitter thread + slide deck |
| Personal story | Vulnerability, connection | LinkedIn post + Instagram caption + newsletter |
| Product/launch | Excitement, FOMO | Twitter thread + email subject lines + short-form video |
| Industry analysis | Authority, insight | Newsletter + LinkedIn post + podcast talking points |
| Contrarian take | Provocation, debate | Twitter post (not thread) + LinkedIn + TikTok |

## Step 3: Generate Platform-Native Versions

For each format, output:

```
## [Platform]: [Angle in 5 words]

**Why this angle for this platform:** [1 sentence: what about this platform's audience
makes this specific angle work here]

**Algorithmic note:** [What this platform's algorithm rewards that this post leans into.
e.g., "LinkedIn boosts posts with high dwell time; the line breaks and story arc
encourage slow reading"]

---

[The actual content, ready to copy-paste]

---

**Posting notes:**
- Best time: [time window]
- Hashtags/tags: [if applicable]
- Engagement play: [what to do in the first 30 min after posting - reply to comments,
  quote-tweet, pin, etc.]
- Pair with: [suggested visual, link, or companion post]
```

## Platform-Specific Craft

### Twitter/X
- **Thread hooks:** The first tweet IS the content. If it doesn't get likes on its own, the thread dies. Write 10 hook options and pick the sharpest.
- **Thread structure:** Each tweet must stand alone AND advance the argument. Number them. End with a CTA to retweet tweet 1.
- **Single tweets:** For takes that don't need a thread. Under 200 chars performs best. Opinions > information.
- **Quote tweets:** If repurposing someone else's content, add a take. Don't just summarize.

### LinkedIn
- **The fold:** First 2-3 lines must hook before "...see more." This is the entire game. Write 5 options for the opening.
- **Line breaks:** After every 1-2 sentences. LinkedIn is read on mobile. Walls of text = scroll past.
- **The "I" hook:** Personal stories outperform advice. "Last week I got fired" beats "5 tips for career resilience."
- **Engagement bait that works:** End with a genuine question. Avoid "Agree?" and ask something specific that people can answer from experience.

### Instagram (Carousel/Caption)
- **Carousel:** 5-10 slides. First slide is the hook (text on bold background). Last slide is CTA. Middle slides = one idea each, max 30 words per slide.
- **Caption:** Front-load the hook before the fold (125 chars). Write like a text message, not a blog post.
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 in first comment, not caption. Mix: 1 broad (500k+ posts), 2 medium (50k-500k), 2 niche (<50k).

### Newsletter
- **Don't summarize the original.** Go deeper. Add the part you cut, the opinion you hedged, the behind-the-scenes of how you formed the take.
- **One clear takeaway.** Readers should be able to articulate "the point" in one sentence.
- **P.S. line:** Most-read part of the email. Use it for a CTA, a teaser for next issue, or a personal aside.

### Short-form video (TikTok/Reels)
- **Structure:** Hook (0-3s) → Context (3-8s) → Value (8-50s) → CTA (50-60s)
- **Hook formulas:** "Stop doing X", "Nobody talks about this", "The reason you're not getting Y", "I spent [time] figuring out X so you don't have to"
- **Script format:** Write as a teleprompter script: short sentences, natural speech, mark pauses with [beat].
- **B-roll notes:** Include visual suggestions in brackets throughout.

## Step 4: Distribution Sequence

After generating all formats, recommend a posting sequence:

```
## Distribution Plan

Day 1: [Platform] - [Why this goes first: "Twitter thread drops first to test the
        hook and see which angle gets traction"]
Day 2: [Platform] - [Why this timing: "LinkedIn post next, referencing the thread's
        engagement as social proof"]
Day 3: [Platform] - [Continue...]
Day 5: [Platform] - [Newsletter goes last: it's the deepest version and benefits
        from knowing which angle resonated on social]
```

**Spacing rule:** Never post the same idea on 2 platforms the same day. It looks lazy and your cross-platform followers will notice.

## Rules

1. **Never just shorten or copy-paste.** If the LinkedIn version reads like a trimmed blog post, you failed.
2. **Every version needs its own hook.** The blog post hook won't work on Twitter. Write a new one.
3. **Preserve voice, shift angle.** The tone stays consistent. The argument changes per platform.
4. **Flag what's missing.** If the source content lacks data, a story, or a clear opinion that a format needs, say so and suggest additions.
5. **Include the uncomfortable version.** For at least one platform, push the take further than the original. The slightly-too-bold version often performs best.
6. **Add platform context the user might not know.** Current algorithm preferences, trending formats, or engagement patterns that affect how the content should be structured.
